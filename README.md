# Cryptographic E-mail Exchange Project
A secure e-mail exchange project for the course "Data Security and Cryptology," focusing on implementing encryption, decryption, secure key generation,
and digital signature verification.

## Objectives
- Encrypt and Decrypt Data: Use ARIA (Advanced Encryption Algorithm) in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode for securing email content.
- Secure Key Generation: Employ Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) for secure key exchange.
- Digital Signature: Implement the ElGamal digital signature scheme for authentication and integrity verification.
